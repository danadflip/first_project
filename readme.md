![:image](http://restaurants.thebusinessrank.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/resasss.jpg)


## Project Idea:
- Create a blog where different users can post reviews of restaurants.  These posts contain written reviews, ratings based on quality, price, atmosphere, and service.  They feature a section where the reviewer can write the deals of the restaurant.

## User Stories:

### As a user:
- I can view the complete feed of restaurant reviews
- I can add your own review with a restaurant name, neighborhood, tags, User Name, written review, date visited, a rating of quality, price, atmosphere and service, and any deals the restaurant may have
- I can see my written review at the top of the feed
- I can sort through the reviews by Neighborhood, Tags, User Name, Quality and Price
- I can individually select a review by clicking on the restaurant name
- I can delete a review on the individual restaurant page


##APIs and Gems:
- Redis Gem - used to access the Redis database to store information
- Sinatra Gem - used to build the framework of the application
- Sinatra/Reloader Gem - used to create new changes to files
- Google Fonts - used to access more interesting fonts


##How to Run Application Locally:

- Run git clone

`$ git clone git@github.com:danadflip/project_one.git
$ cd project_one`
