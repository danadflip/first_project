# Students Like Food Too! - Project 1


## Project Idea:
- Create a blog where different users can post reviews of restaurants.  These posts contain written reviews, ratings based on quality, price, atmosphere, and service.  They feature a section where the reviewer can write the deals of the restaurant.

## User Stories:

### As a user:
- I can view the complete feed of restaurant reviews
- I can add your own review with a restaurant name, neighborhood, tags, User Name, written review, date visited, a rating of quality, price, atmosphere and service, and any deals the restaurant may have
- I can see my written review at the top of the feed
- I can sort through the reviews by Neighborhood, Tags, User Name, Quality and Price
- I can individually select a review by clicking on the restaurant name
- I can delete a review on the individual restaurant page
